# Performance-Predictions
Attempts to predict future performance from past performances. Will focus on Olympic sports and in particular time based sports. I will looks at using time-series based prediction methods to predict future performance, tree based models to find discriminating variables in medal winners and anything else I have time to work on. 

NBA Injury analysis: found injury and player stat data, will look at how different playing variables can be used to predict injury (if at all).
