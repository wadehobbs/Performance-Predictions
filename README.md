# Performance-Predictions
Attempts to predict future performance from past performances. Will focus on Olympic sports and in particular time based sports. I will looks at using time-series based prediction methods to predict future performance. Tree based models to find discriminating variables in gold medal winners and anything else I have time to work on.
